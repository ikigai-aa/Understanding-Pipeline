# Understanding-Pipeline

This notebook works with Iris Flower dataset for prediction ofclassification of different flower species. It uses Pipeline to include a series of different Machine Learning algorithms and performing GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning and at the end the accuracy of the model.
